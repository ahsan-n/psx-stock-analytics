## ⏳ Next Steps

### Step 1: Organize MLCF Reports
Analyze the 18 numbered PDFs and organize them:
```
reports/
  MLCF/
    2020-21/
      MLCF_Annual_2020-21.pdf
      MLCF_2020-21_Q1.pdf
      ...
    2021-22/
      ...
```

### Step 2: Create Database Migration
Apply the new enhanced schema to the database:
- Create Alembic migration
- Run migration
- Verify tables created

### Step 3: Build PDF Parser
Create extraction pipeline:
1. **Table Detection**: Locate financial statement tables
2. **Text Extraction**: Extract line items and values
3. **Data Validation**: Verify extracted numbers
4. **Database Population**: Store in new schema

### Step 4: Extract Real Data
1. Start with FCCL (20 reports)
2. Validate extraction accuracy
3. Move to MLCF (18 reports)
4. Handle extraction errors

### Step 5: Update API & Frontend
- Create new API endpoints for enhanced data
- Update frontend components
- Display additional fields
- Add comparative views

## 📊 Comparison: Mock vs Enhanced Schema

### Mock Schema (Phase 1)
- ❌ Only 9 generic metrics per statement
- ❌ No detailed breakdown
- ❌ Missing critical line items
- ❌ No extraction tracking

### Enhanced Schema (Phase 2)
- ✅ 40+ balance sheet line items
- ✅ 25+ income statement line items
- ✅ 25+ cash flow line items
- ✅ 30+ calculated ratios
- ✅ Extraction confidence scores
- ✅ Metadata and notes support
- ✅ Extraction logging

## 🎯 Benefits of Enhanced Schema

1. **More Realistic Data**: Matches actual financial reports
2. **Better Analysis**: More metrics for comprehensive analysis
3. **Investor-Ready**: Professional-grade financial data
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Year-over-year comparisons
5. **Audit Trail**: Track data sources and confidence
6. **Scalable**: Ready for 500+ PSX companies
